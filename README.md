# phase_detector
Program for detecting whether a sequence of numbers S2 can be mapped onto some sub-sequence of non-repeated numbers of another sequence S1.

If that's the case then the program finds out whether the elements from S2 mapped onto elements of S1 can be expressed
by a linear function on the position of the elements of S1.
